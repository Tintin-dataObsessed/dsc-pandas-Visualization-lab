The average sales price of houses sold in Ames is 180921 this is out of 1460 houses.
The median is the middle value of the 1460 houses in Ames which is as a sales price of ,
of 163000. 
The median is slightly lower than the mean but relatively close so the data is normally distributed,
and the majority of house sale prices are around the average.

the standard deviation is 79442, this means on average the house sales prices deviate from the mean amount.
